jSCD30

    Simple java driver for the <<SCD30>> CO2 (temperature and humidity) sensor. The SCD30 is tested on <<RaspberryPi 3B+>> and uses the I2C BUS.

* About SCD30

    Sensirion SCD30 Sensor Module uses NDIR CO2 sensor technology to sense CO2 and has an integrated temperature and humidity sensor. Ambient humidity and temperature can be measured by monitoring and compensating of external heat sources without the need for additional components. The small module height allows easy integration into different applications. The SCD30 features dual-channel detection for superior stability and Â±30ppm + 3% accuracy.
